		<p>Jeremy Kanovsky is the author of "Apathy: A 21st Century Manifesto". He'd tell you more about himself if he could be bothered.</p>
		<p>Jeremy Kanovsky was intended to be the reincarnation of Robert Lowell but owing to a clerical error is actually the reincarnation of John Berryman. Jeremy is most well known for his attempt to break the world record for typing out the letter W on a keyboard. He is not known, however, for his success in breaking this record.</p>
