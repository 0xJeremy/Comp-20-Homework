1. This lab was implemented according to the spec. Part 2 of the lab does not work as expected, it shouldn't because the the javascript is trying to load a file from a local machine. Part 3 does work as expected when the data is loaded from a URI.
2. This lab was done independently with no collaboration or discussion.
3. Approximately 1 hour was spent on this lab.


It is not possible to load files from a remote location. This is because loading local files poses a security risk where webpages would be able to access files on whatever machine connects to it. Loading files from a different website/origin can result in cross-site scripting and potentially malicious code.
