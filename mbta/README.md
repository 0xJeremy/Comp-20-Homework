1. This lab has been implemented according to the spec. Currently everything described in the spec works properly.
2. This lab was done independently with no collaboration or discussion.
3. Approximately 10 hours was spent on this lab. A large portion of that was trying to debug getting the info window to not appear on the last train stop in the for loop (and was only fixed after a helpful piazza post).

Note: Code in this project was taken from user talkol on Stackoverflow.
